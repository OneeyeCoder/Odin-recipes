    <h2>How to make delicious Mushroom Burgers</h2>
    <p>These vegetarian mushroom burgers are as close as I've ever gotten to delicious meatless burgers.</p> 
    <p>Mushrooms really give them a meaty flavor. </p>
    <p>I like to serve them on fresh hamburger rolls with spicy mayonnaise and a little lettuce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients<h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>⅔ cup rolled oats</li>
            <li>½ cup freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps to cook</h2>
        <ol>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano; 
            cook and stir until mushrooms have released their juices and the liquid has evaporated, 
            about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.</ol>
        <ol>Transfer mushrooms to a cutting board and clean the skillet.</ol>
        <ol>Chop mushrooms into small chunks, then transfer to a large bowl. 
            Mix in bread crumbs and oats, and season with salt and pepper as needed. 
            Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, then eggs; let stand until bread crumbs have absorbed any excess liquid, about 15 minutes. 
            Use moist hands to form mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, into patties.</ol>
        <ol>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium heat. 
            Pan-fry patties in the hot skillet until golden brown and cooked through, 
            2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side.</ol>
