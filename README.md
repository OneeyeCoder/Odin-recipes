 In this project, I have built a basic recipe website to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. 

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

I have demonstrated the skill to write basic HTML boilerplate, link images, use correct tags, syntax and use ordered and unordered lists.
